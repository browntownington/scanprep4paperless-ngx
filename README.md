# scanprep for paperless-ngx

This is a modified version of scanprep to run on paperless-ngx systems to separate documents in the papaerless-ngx consume directory before they are processed by paperless-ngx.

# scanprep â€“ Prepare scanned PDF documents

> Small utility to prepare scanned documents. Supports separating PDF files by separator pages and removing blank pages.

<!-- TODO: GIF showing how to use scanprep -->

Scanprep can be used to prepare scanned documents for further processing with existing tools (like the great [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF)) or directly for archival. It allows splitting multiple documents that were scanned in a single batch into multiple files. In addition, it can also remove blank pages from the output (this is especially helpful if using a duplex scanner).

For document separation, separator pages need to be inserted between the different documents before scanning. These pages tell the program where to split. You can either use the [included separator page](/separator-page.pdf) or create your own. The separator page simply needs to have a barcode that encodes the text `SCANPREP_SEP` (you can use any [barcode type supported by zbar](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/about.html)).

## Installation

### From source

To install scanprep4paperless-ngx from source, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/browntownington/scanprep4paperless-ngx.git
cd scanprep4paperless-ngx
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # You may want to do this in a venv.
# You may also need to install the zbar shared library. See: https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/

python3 scanprep/scanprep-4-paperless.py -h
```

## Usage

We need to run this script as a pre-consumption script. More details here:
https://paperless-ngx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_usage.html#pre-consumption-script

Most simply, you can run scanprep via `scanprep <filename.pdf>`. This will process the input file and output the results into your current working directory. To specify a different output directory, use `scanprep <filename.pdf> <output_directory>`.  
The output files will be called `0-<filename.pdf>`, `1-<filename.pdf>`, and so on.

By default, both page separation and blank page removal will be performed. To turn them off, use `--no-page-separation` or `--no-blank-removal`, respectively.

Use `scanprep -h` to show the help:

```
usage: scanprep [-h] [--page-separation] [--blank-removal] input_pdf [output_dir]

positional arguments:
  input_pdf             The PDF document to process.
  output_dir            The directory where the output documents will be saved. (defaults to the
                        current directory)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --page-separation, --no-page-separation
                        Do (or do not) split document into separate files by the included
                        separator pages. (default yes)
  --blank-removal, --no-blank-removal
                        Do (or do not) remove empty pages from the output. (default yes)
```
